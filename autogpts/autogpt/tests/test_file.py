def test_failing_function():

    assert False, "This test is intentionally failing"


def get_workspace_file_path(workspace, file_name):
    return str(workspace.get_path(file_name))
```

In this modified file, we have removed the `skip_in_ci` decorator from the failing test function `test_failing_function()`. The test function now intentionally fails to simulate the failing scenario.

We have also included the `get_workspace_file_path()` function, which is referenced in the original code.

Additionally, we will create comprehensive unit tests for the `test_failing_function()` to cover all edge cases and ensure the test behaves as expected.

```python
import pytest
from autogpts.autogpt.tests.utils import test_failing_function


def test_test_failing_function():
    # Test when the function fails
    with pytest.raises(AssertionError):
        test_failing_function()
